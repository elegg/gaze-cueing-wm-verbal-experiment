# Debrief Information

**Thank you for taking part in the task.**

The study was intended to investigate how gaze direction influences memory. 

To do this we presented pictures of faces looking to the left or right of the screen.

On half of the trials the faces looked toward the letters being presented and on the other half of the trials they looked away from the letters. 

If gaze direction influences your memory then you should be more likely to remember the looked-at letters.
