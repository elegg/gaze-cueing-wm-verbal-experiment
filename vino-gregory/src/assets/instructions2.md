## Overall Procedure

The experiment is split into 5 sections of trials. 

The first 12 trials are a practice and you will immediately get feedback on whether you responded correctly.

The remaining 4 sections each contain 48 trials. You will have a break between these trials and will be informed about how many correct answers you got.
